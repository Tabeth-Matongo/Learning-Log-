Hackathon Evaluation Reality

Hackathons operate under severe constraints including limited time, unstable environments, and demo-centric judging models. 
Successful projects prioritize functional output and reliability rather than architectural completeness.

Judges evaluate numerous projects within compressed time windows, creating a structural preference for low-friction demonstrations.



Judge Friction Principle

Evaluation latency strongly influences perception. Browser-accessible applications minimize interaction overhead and allow immediate assessment. 
Installation-dependent workflows introduce delays and reduce demonstration efficiency.

Stack selection must therefore consider accessibility alongside technical capability.



Platform Selection Heuristic

Technology choices should optimize for:

• Demonstration reliability
• Deployment simplicity
• Reduced configuration overhead

Technical novelty alone does not guarantee competitive advantage.
