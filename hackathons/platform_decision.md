Platform Tradeoff Model

Platform selection introduces differing risk profiles.

Web applications provide:

• Immediate accessibility
• Device-agnostic evaluation
• Minimal distribution friction

Mobile applications introduce:

• Build dependencies
• Device compatibility considerations
• Installation overhead

Framework choice must align with judging mechanics and project constraints.

Native vs Cross-Platform Considerations

Native development offers deeper system integration and platform-specific performance benefits. Cross-platform frameworks prioritize iteration speed and broader deployment coverage.

Decision variables are constraint-driven rather than preference-driven
